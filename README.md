# 🏗️ Civil Engineering Internship Report – Design and Construction of Residential Building

This repository contains the documentation and outcomes of my civil engineering internship titled **“Design and Construction of 2-3 Storied Residential Building”**. The project was carried out at **Space Structures**, Bangalore as a partial fulfillment for the award of the degree **Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering** under **Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU)** during 2023.

## 📘 Overview

The internship provided hands-on experience in:
- Understanding construction drawings (beams, slabs, footings)
- Steel quantity estimation using MS Excel
- Reinforcement detailing based on IS codes
- Shuttering layout planning and execution
- Site visits and structural observations

## 📂 Key Files
